# rock-paper-scissors

A very much guided project to create a game of rock, paper, scissors, played between a human player and the computer in the console. The game consists of calling a function, which plays 5 rounds of the game, incrementing the scores each round. At the end, the function compares the scores and declares a winner, or a draw. 

What worked well? 
- Working through individual functions, tackling one small problem at a time. It was helpful to understand each function individually and what it's supposed to do. I still don't have the knowledge of all syntax and rules of functions and JS in my head, so it helps to work on one small function at a time, to really help me to understand the smaller parts of code and experiment with the features of the code in a more isolated environment, to build my understanding.


What would you do differently?
 I do not yet have the understanding in my head of the powers and logic of JS features, such as:
    -  the different variants of conditionals specifically what returns truthy values etc (what do i mean by this?? > I was not able to use the 'i' counter from a for loop, to check a conditional in an if statement, though I hope this will be explained in the loops lesson.)
    -  scope of function/loop, specifically when trying to use a variable from one function in another. 
    -  The 'return' of an if statement, and how I can use this in future code? Do i always need to set the result of an if.. statement as a var and then return the var? Or if i invoke the function in the future, the 'return' value will be used?
    -  not sure how to make an if statement which incorporates all options when asking for user input, so how to also account for if user presses cancel, types wrong input or nothing at all.
    -  I think i'm still confused about null, undefined and "". > Linked to above. 
    - the execution stack/order. If I define a function, this will not exectute until it's called using functionName()? 
-I am very quick to start trying to write down code immediately after reading the assignment, but this often means I don't actually understand what I'm trying to solve, leading to frustration as soon as something doesn't work.
- Why am I getting a random 'undefined' at the end of my console?? > Ask on discord. 
-I would like to try going through understand, plan, pseudocode first before going into any coding, to really try to understand and define the problem This will then help to build a base for adding on more advanced functions and features, rather than guessing work and trial and error to make things work, but not understand why or how. > Refresher on pseudocode before next project. 


How will you change the way you approach things? 
- Stay within your means and while I'm still learning, focus on doing what the assignment asks, rather than immediately trying to  make the project work holistically with additional user features (with this one, worrying about how the "human choose weapon" prompt comes on immediately and how that would work as it can block the console/opening dev tools, but this was only during the work on the 2nd function, where it actually turned out that the problem resolved itself towards the end of the assignment. !TRUST THE PROCESS!
- Understand the problem first, before even trying to write any code. Use the UNDERSTAND, PLAN, PSEUDOCODE process.
